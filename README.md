Unique Features - 
The Apartment building can be destroyed with the rocket launcher, other buildings cannot be in the current build. I deemed the parking garage important to stay intact for level verticality, and I did not have the development time to redesign the level. The city hall building I was never able rebuild as a fractured model 


Developer Notes - 
As of the submission date, I do not consider the game complete by any stretch of the imagination. The core of the game is functional, but it is not at what I consider an acceptable standard and I imagine most others would agree with me.
